			<fieldset><legend> <h2>LETS TALK ABOUT RAPUNZEL</h2> </legend><p> A lonely couple, who want a child, live
				next to a walled garden belonging to an evil witch named Dame Gothel. The wife, experiencing the cravings
				associated with the arrival of her long-awaited pregnancy, notices some rapunzel (or, in most
				translated-to-English versions[13] of the story, rampion), growing in the garden and longs for it,
				desperate to the point of death. One night, her husband breaks into the garden to get some for her. She
				makes a salad out of it and greedily eats it. It tastes so good	that she longs for more. So her husband
				goes to get some more for her. As he scales the wall to return home, Dame Gothel catches him and accuses
				him of theft. He begs for mercy, and she agrees to be lenient, and allows him to take all the rapunzel
				he wants, on condition that the baby be given to her when it's born. Desperate, he agrees.

					<h2>DAY 1</h2>
					<p>One day, a prince rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. Entranced
						by her ethereal voice, he searches for her and discovers the tower, but is naturally unable to
						enter it. <br> He returns often, listening to her beautiful singing, and one day sees Dame Gothel
						visit, and thus learns how to gain access to Rapunzel. When Dame Gothel leaves, he bids Rapunzel
						let her hair down. When she does so, he climbs up and they fall in love. He eventually asks her
						to marry him, which she agrees to.</p>
